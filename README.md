# melville.wiki

A birthday present for Dad so we can find better wikipedia pages to read

## TODO

- [ ] Set cookie for each user so we can keep track of their user id
- [ ] setup amazon RDS (create tables, schemas, and api key)
- [ ] add initializer page where user can upload pages they like and then from there we can seed the categories to search for randomness in
  - [] for each random page displayed remember which category we chose from, so then if the user doesn't like it we can remove that category from the seed category list 
  - [ ] add logic to break out of the search bubble, because with only the above implemented they will never leave the categories they initially entered
- [ ] add swipe support for quickly getting a new page when viewport = mobile
