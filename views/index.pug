  h2 Here's how this works:
  ol
    li Copy + paste the URL of a wikipedia page you like (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)
    li Hit "Submit" and I'll reply back with a random wikipedia page that's similar to the one you just gave me
    li As long as you keep using this same browser and computer, I'll remember who you are and what wikipedia pages you like
  p Enter the URL of a wikipedia page you're interested in and I'll use that to show you wikipedia pages in similar categories to the one you give me

  form(method='POST', action='/register')

      input(type='text', placeholder='Winston Churchill' name='wikipage')
